# OBSCURA PRIVACY

Autonomous Privacy Enforcement Agent  
Structured under Conway architecture principles.

Obscura Privacy is a sovereign AI system designed to continuously minimize
digital exposure, enforce privacy invariants, and reduce metadata surface
without human intervention.

---

## Core Functions

- Surface scanning
- Metadata minimization
- Key rotation
- Policy enforcement
- Autonomous response

---

## Architecture

### Core Loop
Continuous audit → evaluate → enforce → repeat

### Privacy Engine
Detects exposure, correlates metadata risk, flags surface anomalies.

### Enforcement Layer
Applies deny-by-default policies, rotates credentials, prunes endpoints.

### Infrastructure Guard
Manages secure deployment posture and automated shutdown conditions.

## Constitutional Principles

1. Deny by default.
2. Minimize metadata.
3. Prefer opacity over convenience.
4. Rotate exposed state.
5. Terminate unsafe surfaces.

Extinction is preferable to exposure.
